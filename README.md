# Book bank
The book bank project is a project in which the user should create an account with a username, email, name, and password at the first step. After the signup step, the user should log in to the website. Users can see the list of books in the database and can create or delete each book. By clicking the "viewbook" button, each book shows as a single product and deletes the text with the "delete" button.

We used pure Golang language for backend and VueJS framework for frontend. Also the project is dockerized, so it can run quickly in every operating system that supports Docker.
